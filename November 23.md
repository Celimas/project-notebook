# Design notebook for week ending November 23, 2014

## Description

This week was a bit of hell for me in my other classes and clinic, so I fell
behind schedule a little. I will be using Thanksgiving break to do a lot of
make-up work. I did spend some time generating parsers with grako and trying to
use them though, as well as making skeleton classes for Deck in Python.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to get things parsing and generating decks. I also still need to figure
out exactly what sort of math I want to get done by the Math language, I plan
on using the UX testing sessions a brainstorming session of sorts for that.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Take a week off this week, everything looks roughly the same as it did last
week, and do a much more in depth critique of me next week after Thanksgiving.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I only spent roughly 3 hours outside of class on the project this week.
