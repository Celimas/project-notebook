# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

**Once again, my work cycle doesn't really allow a ton of DSLs work over the weekend, but I have a huge chunk on Monday, so this will be updated tonight**

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Please hold off on critiquing me until Tuesday, I should have significantly more progress to show, and it would be great to get a critique before the final project. Thanks!

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
