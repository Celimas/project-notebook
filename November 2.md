# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

This week I spent setting up the github repos for the notebook and the project
itself. Aditionally, I completed the preliminary project summaries in order for
my ideas to be critiqued by another group. I do not yet have any progress on my
DSL itself.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I still need to make ALL the decisions. Mostly, I need to figure out a host
language that is both easy to parse in, and easy to do math/output plots in.
Right now I'm leaning towards Scala, although Python is also an option.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Do you have host language suggestions? 

Also, what do you, as outside observers, think of the schedule I laid out in
plan.md. Does it seem reasonable? Too much work in some weeks? Too little in
others?


**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Overall, this week's work took 2-3 hours outside of class to write everything
up, and another hour or so to collect my thoughts on the matters beforehand.
